This repository contains various files related to "homotopy type
theory". Each subdirectory contains a README file which you can
inspect to get a description of what is in there.


The repository contains submodules for Vladimir Voevodsky's and
Peter Lumsdaine's repositories. You can obtain those automatically
by giving the --recursive option when you clone this repository:

  git clone --recursive <this-repository-address>

If you have already cloned this repository without --recursive,
you can still get the submodules with

  git submodule update --init --recursive
