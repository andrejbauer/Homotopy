This folder contains the files from the Coq tutorial given by Andrej
Bauer at the 2011 Oberwolfach meeting.

You can:

(0) Read OUTLINE.txt to get some idea what was presented at the workshop.

(1) Compile the files by running the command "make". This will compile
    Coq files and generate documentation, as well as a PDF version of
    univalence.v. If you do not have the make utility, you can still
    generate univalence.pdf, see instructions in univalence.tex.

    If make complains, fix the settings in Makefile (tell it where to
    find coqc, coqdoc and pdflate).

(2) Go through the .v files with your favorite Coq environment.
